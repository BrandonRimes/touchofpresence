    <article>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Our aim</span> is to support, educate, and nurture those who are interested in shifting their identity from the story of their ego mind and personality to the openness of who you really are. We help you develop and listen to this alignment of truth so you can rediscover for yourself the reality of your own precious existence, which is underneath all the family and cultural conditioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you become aligned with this truth, learn how to bring it into contact with others, and hold it for longer periods of time, you will be able to stay present and see the reality of what is, without any conditioned filters, within everything and everyone. You will discover that you are truly One with all that exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firmly grounded in the present moment, within a safe environment, we help to uncover, increase awareness, and de-contract from physical, neuronal, and emotional conditioned patterns that are held within the body, mentally, physically, and unconsciously. Transformation starts with curiosity and wonder about Truth, whether it’s within the physical body or within the mind.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">We use a multitude of tools</span> in an integrated way, by exploring early childhood development, attachment theory, meditation, breath work, conscious movement, anatomy and physiology, body oriented character pattern conditioning, releasing involuntary armoring, trauma and held stress, neuroscience, nervous system regulation, and more. The real learning isn’t within these concepts, teachings, or words. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The real learning arises from the ability to, connect with oneself (creating expansion), while staying in contact with others, while naming the temporary conditioned patterning (contracting). The learning of this isn’t in the words and what your ideal image or concept is of this. This type of exploring takes practice in developing this skill in the ability to quickly and easily access. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It has a back and forth state of expansion - contraction that resembles a symphony like dance which is quite beautifully vulnerable when you interact with life in this way. Once you truly connect with yourself, bring that into connection with others it eliminates duality, boundaries and creates the expression of joy and love within everything and everyone. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although there are mysteries in the world that cannot be explained, waking up isn’t mystical, everyone can do it. You have to be willing to look at the Truth of who you really are and focus your attention there. Not on who you take yourself to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experiential exploring is done both individually and collectively in a group. Watching others break free of their trauma, stress, conditioned patterns, holding, etc., is an essential part of the real education. Is is very different than cognitive revelry. To understand the teachings, learn through modeling, and really getting it on a felt-sense cellular level through osmosis, is the ability to unwaveringly hold your state of presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you are just looking for <span class="aboutEmphasis">therapeutic bodywork</span> or if you are sincerely interested in exploring the deeper aspects of the self, have one particular issue you want to work on, or have a calling towards this type of work, we can fit any of those needs.

        Ildikó is an <span class="bioEmphasis">ATP Integration Practitioner,</span> which is a body oriented investigative approach into what it means to be open, whole, and feel safe to fully exist in the world and then bring that existence into contact and connection with others. She has spent her life both personally and professionally working on this simple truth. 
      </p>
      <p>
        ATP work integrates many fields of study which include neuroscience, psychology, anatomy & physiology, breath work, meditation, conscious movement, and more. It supports individuals seeking to release stressful beliefs & thoughts, idealized thinking, emotional, and physical traumas that are held within the body and mind in a coalesced way. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        Underneath the conditioned patterns, you gain understanding as to how and why you learned to interact with the world and how to be present by going deeper into the Truth of your existence and allow that to shine through in all its different parts really feeling the wholeness of who you really are. 
      </p>
      <p>  
        Ildikó has been a <span class="bioEmphasis">Nationally Certified Massage Therapist since 2007.</span> She decided to pursue her massage license after working as a Yoga Instructor with clients at her private studio in Pennsylvania. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        Inspired by her love of body mechanics, movement, and desire to learn more on how human conditioning and behavior operates the decisions we make in our daily lives, she wanted to further discover exactly what the reality of what it means to truly exist in the world.

      <p>Trauma affects the body on many different levels. Some people don’t even realize how much they're storing/holding within their whole system. Using Awakening to Presence (ATP) practices you learn to bring awareness within the parts of the whole system, letting go and allowing any conditioned patterns to release, and realigning with truth.
      Sessions are done with loose clothing, includes 15 minute check in, and may include bodywork, movement, cognitive understanding, among other methods chosen by the practitioner to help educate and facilitate release of body contraction.</p>

      <p>Once you have learned to effectively begin releasing parts of the conditioned patterning in Beginner Integrative Release, you will explore this truth moving more deeply into the true nature of your existence. Allowing patterns to show up as they are requires safety, trust and willingness to go deeper. Exploring the unconscious patterns that keep repeating, the patterns we get hung up on the most and keep us from our deepest desires of true connection are challenging to explore alone.
      Sessions include check in, cognitive and felt sense exploration, and recommended group work. </p>

      <p>Ashi = Foot, Atsu = Pressure. Using barefoot massage techniques (foot compressions and gliding) to deliver a deep tissue massage, the practitioner uses overhead bars for support. The foot is broad and makes compression smooth therefore not painful. Pressure can be adjusted at a level that's comfortable for the client. It provides deep relaxation, in addition to releasing adhesions, held tensions, and toxins at a more rapid rate compared to traditional massage techniques.</p>
