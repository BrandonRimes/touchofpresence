          <p>If you are experiencing anxiety, stress, tension, physical or emotional pain, are looking to let go of habits, thoughts, beliefs that no longer serve you, wanting deeper connection with yourself and others, then ATP may be right for you.</p>
          <p>How do you integrate science and presence? ATP is is done through having experiences of awakening and making neuronal changes within the circuitry in connections of your brain. It is a multi supportive way in helping those who are interested in moving from identifying with the story of the mind and personality to shifting into the openness to the vast connection of who you really are. ATP means aligning with reality to your deepest most precious existence of who you are, vs the illusion of who you think you are.</p>

        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Our aim is to support, educate, and nurture</span>
        you increasing your awareness of who you are in each given moment without judgement or shame. Alignment with this presence takes practice and an ability to really see you, past any unconscious conditioned pattern, habit, belief, thought, etc., which are held within body. This holding can cause physical, emotional and spiritual pain and halt any personal growth in all areas of your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">We support those who are interested in</span>
        developing and listening to the deeper meaning and reality of who you are beyond your ego, neuronal firing, family or cultural conditioning, personality, anxiety, thoughts, beliefs, etc. Using a multitude of tools I’ll help you explore and discover a more integrated way of being. The real learning is uncovering the connection with the self while you stay in connection with others and name the temporary conditioning thoughts patterns and beliefs. It’a a practicing in the back and forth synchronicity between illusion and reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Waking up isn’t mystical, everyone can do it.</span>
        You have to be willing to recognize, look at and move through the illusion you’ve created and see the reality that’s always here and available to you and focus your attention there. It takes time and commitment. This exploring is through experience individually and collectively in witnessing yourself and others break free of their trauma, stress, conditioned patterns, holding, etc. It’s an essential part of the real education and learning.

      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Whether you are looking for therapeutic bodywork</span>
        or if you are sincerely interested in exploring the deeper aspects of the self, we can help you relax, explore and discover your deeper reality and understanding of who you are. We do not push ideals, methods, religions, beliefs, or concepts.

        in 2019, which she has dedicated the past 10 + years of learning. ATP is a experiential body oriented investigative approach into the true nature of human existence. This form of study integrates many fields which include neuroscience, psychology, anatomy and physiology, breath work, meditation, conscious movement, and more. It supports individuals seeking to release stressful beliefs, thoughts, emotional, and physical traumas that are held within the body and mind in an integrated way. Underneath the conditioned patterns, you gain understanding as to how and why you consciously and unconsciously interact with the world and how to truly be present by going deeper into the Truth of your existence, allow that to shine through fully, and bring it into contact with others. It is the true meaning of intimacy and connection with the Self/Oneness.

      <p>Trauma affects the body on many different levels. Some people don’t even realize how much they're storing/holding within their whole system. Using Awakening to Presence (ATP) practices you learn to bring awareness within the parts of the whole system, letting go and allowing any conditioned patterns to release, and realigning with truth.
      Sessions are done with loose clothing, includes 15 minute check in, and may include bodywork, movement, cognitive understanding, among other methods chosen by the practitioner to help educate and facilitate release of body contraction.</p>

      <p>Once you have learned to effectively begin releasing parts of the conditioned patterning in Beginner Integrative Release, you will explore this truth moving more deeply into the true nature of your existence. Allowing patterns to show up as they are requires safety, trust and willingness to go deeper. Exploring the unconscious patterns that keep repeating, the patterns we get hung up on the most and keep us from our deepest desires of true connection are challenging to explore alone.
      Sessions include check in, cognitive and felt sense exploration, and recommended group work. </p>

      <p>Ashi = Foot, Atsu = Pressure. Using barefoot massage techniques (foot compressions and gliding) to deliver a deep tissue massage, the practitioner uses overhead bars for support. The foot is broad and makes compression smooth therefore not painful. Pressure can be adjusted at a level that's comfortable for the client. It provides deep relaxation, in addition to releasing adhesions, held tensions, and toxins at a more rapid rate compared to traditional massage techniques.</p>
