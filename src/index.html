          <p>If you are experiencing anxiety, stress, tension, physical or emotional pain, are looking to let go of habits, thoughts, beliefs that no longer work for you, or if you are longing for or wanting a deeper connection with yourself and others, then ATP may be right for you.</p>
          <p>How do you integrate science and presence? It is done through having experiences of awakening, which creates neuronal changes in the circuitry, wiring, and connections within your brain. It is a multi supportive way in helping those who are interested in moving from identifying with the story of their mind, personality or idealistic versions of your self, to shifting into the vast openness and connection to who you really are. ATP means aligning with reality to the most deepest part of your precious existence, holding this part of you at all times, who you really are, vs the false illusion, ideal, or conditioning of who you think you are or have been taught or learned to be.</p>

      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Our aim is to support, educate, and nurture</span>
        you in helping to increase your awareness to the consistent, reliable, available “enoughness”, the deepest part of you in any given moment, without judgement or shame. To allow yourself to be fully who you are, while maintaining integrity, and not trying to justify, excuse or rationalize any of your conscious or unconscious rascal behavior as “this is just who I am”, It is an incredibly humbling and freeing experience to be here now fully.
      </p>
      <p>This is a practice, to really see past any conscious and more importantly the unconscious conditioned pattern, habits, behaviors, beliefs, thoughts, etc., which are held within your body. This holding can cause physical, emotional and spiritual pain. It can halt any personal growth in all areas and aspects of your life. You can feel stuck in these habitual patterns and behaviors and not no know what to do about it, leaving you feeling frustrated, angry, depressed, disconnected, lonely. Or feeling like you have to smile all the time to hide your true state or self medicate with alcohol, gummies, vape, etc., to numb yourself from it all.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">We support those who are interested in</span>
        developing and listening to the deeper meaning of reality, beyond the ego, neuronal circuit wiring, family or cultural conditioning, personality, anxiety, fear, etc. Using a multitude of tools, I’ll help you explore and discover a more integrated way of being. The real learning is uncovering the connection with the self while you stay in connection with others, real connection without thoughts, words, narratives, beliefs…. True connection. Naming the temporary conditioning, thoughts patterns, and beliefs, in the story of who you think you are is just the beginning, this practice takes you much deeper than you thought was possible. It’s a practicing, in the back and forth synchronicity between illusion and reality, until you are able to stay in the reality longer and longer and pop over or simply put, stay permanently. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Waking up isn’t mystical, everyone can do it.</span>
        You have to be willing to recognize, look at, and move through the illusion you’ve created and see the reality that’s always here and available to you and focus your attention there. It takes time and commitment. This exploring is done through individual experiences (one on one with the practitioner) and collectively (in a group). When we witness ourself and bring it into contact with others, it is incredibly powerful. It’s an essential part of the real education and learning. Are you ready to break free of your trauma, stress, conditioned patterns, holding, etc.?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Whether you are looking for therapeutic bodywork</span>
        or if you are sincerely interested in exploring the deeper aspects of the self, your story, your personality, and moving through that into diving deeper. We can help you relax, explore and discover the deeper reality and understanding of your truth. We do not push ideals, methods, religions, beliefs, or concepts.

        in 2007 after graduating from massage school and is licensed through the Virginia Board of Nursing. She made the decision to pursue her massage/bodywork license after working as a Yoga Instructor with clients at her private studio in Pennsylvania. Inspired by her love of body mechanics, movement, and especially in her desire to learn more on how human conditioning and behavior operates the decisions we make in our daily lives, she has spent her life, both personally and professionally, working on the truth of what it really means to be present in your own truth and bring that into contact with others.

        <span class="bioEmphasis">Ildikó grauduated as an Awakening To Presence Integration Practitioner</span>
        in 2019, which she has dedicated the past 10 + years to this type of learning. ATP is a body oriented investigative approach based on having experiences into the true nature of human existence. This form of study integrates many fields which include neuroscience, psychology, anatomy and physiology, breath work, meditation, conscious movement, and more. It supports individuals seeking to release stressful beliefs, thoughts, emotional, and physical traumas that are held within the body and mind in an integrated way. Underneath the conditioned patterns, you gain understanding as to how and why you consciously and unconsciously interact with the world and how to truly be present by going deeper into the Truth of your existence, allow that to shine through fully, and bring it into contact with others. It is the true meaning of intimacy and connection with the Self/Oneness.

      <p>Trauma affects the body on many different levels. Some people don’t even realize how much they're storing/holding within their whole system. Using Awakening to Presence (ATP) practices you learn to bring awareness within the parts of the whole system, letting go and allowing any conditioned patterns to release, and realigning with truth.
      Sessions are done with loose clothing, includes 15 minute check in, and may include bodywork, movement, cognitive understanding, among other methods chosen by the practitioner to help educate and facilitate release of body contraction.</p>

      <p>Once you have learned to effectively begin releasing parts of the conditioned patterning in Beginner Integrative Release, you will explore this truth moving more deeply into the true nature of your existence. Allowing patterns to show up as they are requires safety, trust and willingness to go deeper. Exploring the unconscious patterns that keep repeating, the patterns we get hung up on the most and keep us from our deepest desires of true connection are challenging to explore alone.
      Sessions include check in, cognitive and felt sense exploration, and recommended group work. </p>

      <p>Ashi = Foot, Atsu = Pressure. Using barefoot massage techniques (foot compressions and gliding) to deliver a deep tissue massage, the practitioner uses overhead bars for support. The foot is broad and makes compression smooth therefore not painful. Pressure can be adjusted at a level that's comfortable for the client. It provides deep relaxation, in addition to releasing adhesions, held tensions, and toxins at a more rapid rate compared to traditional massage techniques.</p>
