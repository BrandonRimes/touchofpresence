          <p>
            If you are experiencing anxiety, stress, tension, physical or emotional pain, are looking to let go of habits, thoughts, beliefs that no longer work for you, or if you are longing for or wanting a deeper connection with yourself and others or simply lost your basic ability to relax, then Neuronal Integration may be right for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            How do you integrate science and presence? Holding shifts in consciousness takes time and more importantly practice. Everyone one can have a moment of awakening. You can spend 5 minutes in nature and be extremely alive, alert and present. However, it’s holding this state, those sensations, that people struggle with the most.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more experiences you have with the present moment, it creates neuronal changes in the circuitry, wiring, and connections within your brain. It is a multi supportive way in helping those who are interested in moving from identifying with the story of their mind, personality or idealistic versions of themselves, to shifting into the vast openness and connection to who you most truly are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neuronal Integration means aligning with reality within the deepest part of your precious existence, holding this state at all times. Basically who you really are vs the false illusion, thoughts, the best idealistic version you can be, or conditioning of of that ideal version of who you “think” you are, have become, or have been taught and learned how to be.

      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Our aim is to support, educate, and nurture</span>
        you in helping to increase your awareness and experiences of the deepest part of you that is consistent, reliable, available, and enough, in any given moment, without judgement or shame. To allow yourself to be fully who you are, while maintaining integrity, and not trying to justify, excuse or rationalize any of your conscious or unconscious “rascal” behavior. It is an incredibly humbling and freeing experience to be here fully.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a practice, to really see past any conscious and more importantly the unconscious conditioned patterning, habits, behaviors, beliefs, thoughts, perceptions, etc., which are held within your body. This holding can cause physical, emotional and spiritual pain. It can halt any personal growth in all areas and aspects of your life. You can feel stuck in these habitual patterns and behaviors and not know what to do about it, leaving you feeling frustrated, angry, depressed, disconnected, and lonely. Or feeling like you have to wear a mask all the time to hide your true state or self medicate with alcohol, gummies, vape, etc., to numb yourself from it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">We support those who are interested in</span>
        developing and listening to the deeper meaning of reality, beyond the ego, neuronal circuit wiring, family or cultural conditioning, personality, anxiety, fear, etc. Using a multitude of tools, I’ll help you explore and discover a more integrated way of being. The real learning is uncovering the connection with the self while you stay in connection with your environment/others.  Having real connection without thoughts, words, narratives, beliefs, simple true heartfelt connection. Naming the temporary conditioning, thought patterns, and beliefs, in the story of who you think you are is just the beginning, this practice takes you much deeper than you thought was possible. It’a a practicing, in the back and forth synchronicity between illusion and reality, until you are able to stay in the reality of you for longer periods of time. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Waking up isn’t mystical, everyone can do it.</span>
        You have to be willing to recognize, look at and move through the illusions you’ve created and then focus your attention there. It takes time and commitment. This exploring is done through individual experiences (one on one with the practitioner) and collectively (in a group). When we witness ourself and bring it into contact with others, it is incredibly powerful. It’s an essential part of the real education and learning. Are you ready to break free of your trauma, stress, conditioned patterns, holding, unhappiness, etc.?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Whether you are looking for therapeutic bodywork</span>
        or if you are sincerely interested in exploring the deeper aspects of the self, your story, your personality, and moving through that into diving deeper. We can help you relax, explore and discover the deeper reality and understanding of your truth. We do not push ideals, methods, religions, beliefs, or concepts. Your growth is solely your responsibility, and the pace in which you move.
      <p>
        Connecting with the deeper parts of yourself is like tapping into the still depths of the ocean, riding the chaotic waves on the surface. The stillness never wavers or goes away. It is always there in every present moment, calling to you like a siren, asking nothing from you only to notice what is already there.

        in 2007 after graduating from massage school and is licensed through the Virginia Board of Nursing. She made the decision to pursue her massage/bodywork license after working as a Yoga Instructor with clients at her private studio in Pennsylvania. Inspired by her love of body mechanics, movement, and especially in her desire to learn more on how human conditioning and behavior operates the decisions we make in our daily lives, she has spent her life, both personally and professionally, working on the truth of what it really means to be present and bring that into contact with others.

      <p>
        <span class="bioEmphasis">Ildikó grauduated as an Awakening To Presence Integration Practitioner</span>
        in 2019, which she has dedicated the past 10 + years to this type of learning. ATP is a body oriented investigative approach based on having experiences into the true nature of human existence. This form of study integrates many fields which include neuroscience, psychology, anatomy and physiology, breath work, meditation, conscious movement, and more. It supports individuals seeking to release stressful beliefs, thoughts, emotional, and physical traumas that are held within the body and mind in an integrated way. Underneath the conditioned patterns, you gain understanding as to how and why you consciously and unconsciously interact with the world and how to truly be present by going deeper into the Truth of your existence, allow that to shine through fully, and bring it into contact with others. It is the true meaning of intimacy and connection with the Self/Oneness.

        <p>
          • For your first appointment, please arrive 5-10 minutes prior to fill out necessary paperwork. Your provider will bring you into the treatment room, go over your initial form, answer any questions and immediate concerns you may be having.
        </p>
        <p>
          • After initial intake your therapist will leave the room to prepare for your service and will knock before coming back in.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Turn off your cell phone. This is your time to focus on you.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Allow the relaxation of the work you did. Don’t go straight back into a hard or light workout, or straight back to a grinding work day. Take time to enjoy the pleasure of letting go of the story of your conditioning and all the tension your body holds from that.</p>
        <h3 id="faqA2" class="faqAnswer">Massage</h3>
        <p>
          • Please fill out all necessary paperwork online prior to your appointment. If you do not receive the paperwork, via email, reach out and let us know. If you do not do this and paperwork doesn’t get filled out prior to your appointment this could result in a shortened session at your visit since appointments are carefully scheduled and it’s likely there is another client lined up to come in right after you.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Please arrive fresh and clean. You may want to exfoliate your skin using a loofa, exfoliating mitt or glove prior to your appointment.
        </p>
        <p>
          • No need to apologize for unshaven legs. It’s not something our therapists even think about.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Do not come to your session feeling sick. If you are ill you can not be massaged and will need to send you home.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Drink water before and after your appointment. Hydration helps flush out toxins, creates glowing hydrated skin, and makes you feel great. Who doesn’t want that?
        </p>
        <p>
          • Communicate your goals and boundaries with your therapist before the sessions begins. Undress to your comfort level. Generally, the less clothing you wear it makes it easier to treat you. With Ashiatsu your therapist goes down the length of your body and it’s easier to not have anything in the way, however the therapist can work around your underwear. Please avoid bras which tend to be harder to work around. You can expect to be draped during the entirety of your massage. Gluteal massage is typically included in a full body massage, but you may opted out if that is not at your comfort level.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Emotional/somatic release can occur during a session. If you feel uncomfortable with this and would like to stop your session get dressed and finish your session with some coaching please communicate this clearly and directly. Although emotions can surprise you, nothing will be pushed, talked about, or come up if you don’t want it to.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Communicate! ASK FOR WHAT YOU NEED. I can not stress this enough. Through out your massage if you are feeling the massage isn’t relaxing, the pressure is too much or too little, or you are needing silence that day, tell your therapist! Your voice is welcome here. Some clients get a lot out of speaking, it’s like therapy for them, however your therapist doesn’t always know if today you want to talk or you’re finished talking and want quiet. Your therapist WILL NOT be offended if you ask for what you need. You will thanked for your bravery and honesty in asking for what you need!!
        </p>
        <h3 id="faqA3" class="faqAnswer">ATP/Neuronal Coaching & Bodywork Sessions</h3>
        <p>
          • ATP/Neuronal bodywork sessions are always done with loose fitted clothing, t-shirt and shorts or sweatpants. You may bring those items with you and change into them after the therapist does discusses and asses the need with each session.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Please arrive fresh and clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Do not come to your session feeling sick for yourself and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Doing this type of work can bring up a lot of emotions, physical releasing, and you will be asked to challenge yourself to feel better and work through stubborn patterning/conditioning. Communication in where you are can change quickly and often so communication is important.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Silence is also important to listen to what your body has to say and what your practitioner is instructing. Your practitioner will not judge where you are however they will gently or sternly guide what you cannot see at times. Try your best to have an open mind.
        </p>
        <h3 id="faqA4" class="faqAnswer">What is our change and cancellation policy?</h3>
        <p>
          • Our therapists are in high demand and often booked up a week or more in advance. We understand that things can come up in life however late cancelations have a direct impact on their livelihood, so we ask that you call, text, or cancel online 48 hours in advance. Cancelations made less than 48 hours of your appointment time will be charged a fee equal to 50% of the appointment value. Cancellations on the same day of your appointment will be charged 100% of the appointment value, as the likelihood for us to rebook the appointment time is narrowed and our therapists would otherwise go unpaid.

        <p>
          • It is a priority to have our clients and therapists safe. Our COVID-19 protocols are informed by the CDC, the Virginia Department of Health, and the American Massage Therapy Association.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Masks are optional for both clients and therapists.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Our therapists have vaccine or natural immunity against COVID-19. We test and isolate according to the CDC guidelines at the presence of symptoms or if a known exposure has occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          • All surfaces are cleaned and sanitized before and after each session (using medical-grade cleaning spray, laundering all materials that are machine-washable, etc.)
        </p>
        <p>
          • Air purifier is in your treatment room.
        </p>
        <p>
          • If you have any of the symptoms of COVID-19, including high fever, cough, shortness of breath, or loss of taste or smell, we ask that you call to reschedule your appointment.

        <h3 id="faqA7" class="faqAnswer">How do payments work?</h3>
        <p>
          • We require a credit card to hold all appointments. This allows us to enforce our cancelation policy. If you have a gift certificate you would like to use please call 804-904-9025 to schedule your appointment and be sure to bring the certificate with you at the time of your visit. Payments are taken after services are rendered unless a payment has been enforced as part of our cancelation policy, which is where we take payment prior to your appointment.
        </p>
        <p>
          • In the future I plan on accepting credit cards however currently we accept cash, checks, Venmo and gift certificates. Gratuity may be added to gift certificates, we do however appreciate direct tipping via cash or Venmo.
        </p>
        <h3 id="faqA8" class="faqAnswer">What should I tip?</h3>
        <p>
          • This questions crosses peoples minds and we get asked this question a lot. Being a massage therapists is a physically demanding job and therapist count on gratuities. Clients who really enjoyed the service can tip anywhere from 10%, 15%, to 20% of the total service amount. Just like any service oriented profession, it’s based on how well the service was performed, in addition to your individual means.
