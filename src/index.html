        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Our Mission</span>
        At The Touch Of Presence, our mission is to empower, educate, and nurture individuals on their journey towards self-awareness and self-acceptance. We strive to help you tap into the deepest parts of yourself—those aspects that are inherently authentic, unwavering, and whole, without judgment or shame.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Embracing Authenticity</span>
        Embarking on this journey means delving deep within your patterning consciously and more crucially seeing the unconscious conditioning within patterns, habits, beliefs, and perceptions that reside within your being. Such internalized holding can inflict physical, emotional, and spiritual distress, hindering personal growth and leaving you ensnared in repetitive patterns, feelings of frustration, anger, or loneliness. You might find yourself donning a facade or resorting to substances to numb the pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Our Approach</span>
        Our approach revolves around the practice of bringing awareness and consciousness to conditioned patterns, habits, and beliefs that reside within your being. These ingrained patterns can manifest as physical, emotional, and spiritual pain, hindering personal growth and leaving you feeling stuck, frustrated, and disconnected. Through our guidance and support, we aim to empower you to navigate beyond these limitations, fostering and inspiring a deeper understanding of reality that transcends ego, societal conditioning, and fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Tools for Self-Exploration</span>
        We offer a diverse range of tools and techniques designed to facilitate self-exploration and discovery. Whether through individual sessions or group settings, we encourage you to delve into the depths of your consciousness, exploring the interconnectedness between self and environment. By naming and acknowledging conditioning, thought patterns, and beliefs, you can embark on a transformative journey towards self-realization and authenticity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Embracing Vulnerability</span>
        Waking up to your true nature is not an esoteric concept reserved for a select few—it is a journey accessible to all who are willing to confront their illusions and redirect their attention inward. This process requires time, commitment, and a willingness to embrace vulnerability. Through our collaborative efforts, we invite you to break free from the constraints of trauma, stress, and conditioned patterns, and embark on a path of self-discovery and liberation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Uncovering and Transforming</span>
        At our core, our practice is about uncovering and transforming, beyond conditioning. A journey for all, connecting with your inner depths, and sustaining presence beyond what you could dream of experiencing. We encourage you to stand unabashedly in your authenticity, upholding integrity, and facing both your conscious and unconscious tendencies without justification or evasion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Personalized Growth Journey</span>
        Whether you seek therapeutic bodywork or are eager to explore the deeper dimensions of self, we are here to support you every step of the way. We do not impose ideologies, methods, or beliefs onto our clients; rather, we empower you to take ownership of your growth journey at your own pace. Our approach includes guiding individuals to recognize unconscious behaviors, even when confronting the challenging aspects of oneself may not be easy. We provide direct, empathetic support, fostering an environment where you feel encouraged to confront and work through these areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="aboutEmphasis">Embrace Self-Discovery</span>
        Connecting with the deeper aspects of yourself is akin to diving into the still depths of the ocean amidst turbulent waves. The stillness that resides within you remains unwavering, beckoning you to embrace it with open arms. At The Touch Of Presence, we invite you to embark on a journey of self-discovery, where the depths of your truth await your exploration.

        <div id="ildikoImg" class="tribeImages"></div>
      </div>
      <p>
        <span class="bioEmphasis">Ildikó obtained her National Certification through NCBTMB</span>
        in 2007 after graduating from massage school she began her career in bodywork. She is currently licensed through the Virginia Board of Nursing. She made the decision to pursue her massage/bodywork license after working as a Yoga Instructor with clients at her private studio in Pennsylvania. Inspired by her love of body mechanics, movement, and especially her desire to learn more on how human conditioning and behavior operates the decisions we make in our daily lives, she has spent her life, both personally and professionally, working on the truth of what it really means to be present and bring that into contact with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bioEmphasis">Ildikó practices Neuronal Integration</span>
        which uses Awakening To Presence methods developed by Michael Fleming. Ildikó is an Awakening To Presence Integrated Partitioner. This type of integration is a body oriented investigative approach based in having experiences into the deeper nature of human existence.
      </p>
      <p>  
        This form of study integrates many fields which include neuroscience, psychology, anatomy and physiology, breath work, meditation, conscious movement, and more. It supports individuals seeking to release stressful beliefs, thoughts, emotional, and physical traumas that are held within the body and mind in an integrated way.
      </p>
      <p> 
        The more experiences you have with the present moment promotes neuronal changes in the circuitry, wiring, and connections within your brain. This type of mindbodyspirit training creates more flexibility, options, and capacity in making choices that work in alignment with what you truly want, a deeper connection with yourself and others, and therefore creating the life you are meant to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neuronal Integration is a multi supportive way of being, which helps those who are interested in moving from identifying with the story of their mind, personality or idealistic versions of themselves, to shifting into the vast openness and connection to who you most truly are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neuronal Integration means aligning with the reality and holding your precious existence, while interacting with others and life. What does presence “look” like to you and being present as it exists, are two different things. Neuronal Integration methods can get you back in touch with who you really are vs who or people think you “should” or "should not” be, the false illusions and perceptions, the best “ideal” roles you play, or the conditioned patterns you were taught within a dysfunctional family system that you were shamed into performing. Those ways of being go against all of our innate abilities to be seen, heard, loved, guided and cared for as a human being.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are aligned in the present moment it sometimes calls for peaceful stillness, kindness, compassion, while other moments require you to stand up, state your boundaries, assert your voice and take assertive action steps. To sit back with the “appearance” of passive peacefulness while others are crossing boundaries in an aggressive manner with shame, threats, and judgment, is not presence. All beings have a right to empathy, to have their voices spoken, heard, and respected even if you disagree. Being assertive in awareness and taking action is being present vs passively sitting back and watching, turning a blind eye, or aggressively pushing your thoughts and perceptions on another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ildikó has dedicated the past 10 + years to this type of learning and transformation. This form of study integrates many fields which include neuroscience, psychology, anatomy and physiology, breath work, meditation, conscious movement, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bioEmphasis">Ildikó combines her clinically based techniques,</span>

        </p>
        <p>
          Neuronal Integration offers a multi-faceted approach to the integration of body, mind, and spirit. It is designed for those looking to move beyond identifying with the stories of their minds, their personalities, or idealistic versions of themselves. By shifting away from rigid thoughts, perceptions, and beliefs, you can open up to a vast sense of connection and awareness with each passing moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This practice is about aligning with reality at the deepest level of your existence and maintaining this state amidst life's chaos. It helps cultivate awareness, peacefulness, and appropriate action in each moment, contrasting with the conditioned patterns and illusions we often hold onto.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="servicesInlineEmphasis">What does presence meran to you?</span>  Is it a monk, guru, or yogi in a state of perpetual peace, or is it someone who navigates each moment with awareness, kindness, and love? We all have moments of anger, masks of smiles, and addictions as escapes. If these methods no longer serve you, why not try something different? There's no judgment here—only an invitation to explore what truly brings meaning to your life.

          <span class="servicesInlineEmphasis">Where do you store your stress?</span> In your neck, shoulders, or back? Or perhaps your emotions are hidden in your jaw, lower back, or hips. Stress and negative thinking can manifest physically, leading to tension, high blood pressure, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and more.

          Our bodywork services are tailored to help you release, let go, and relax.

          <span class="servicesInlineEmphasis">Swedish</span>
          <br>
          A traditional Swedish massage uses light, medium, or firm pressure to promote relaxation, stimulate nerve endings, and increase blood flow and lymph drainage. This gentle technique is ideal for those seeking relaxation and tension relief. If you need help with an injury or require deeper work, our Deep Tissue/Ashiatsu massage may be more suited to your needs.

          <span class="servicesEmphasis"></span>
          <span class="servicesInlineEmphasis">Ashiatsu Therapy</span>
          <br>
          <span class="servicesInlineEmphasis">Ashiatsu</span> (Ashi = Foot, Atsu = Pressure) uses foot compressions with overhead bars for support. The broad foot compressions provide smooth, deep pressure that releases adhesions, tension, and toxins more rapidly than traditional techniques. Each session includes a consultation to understand your specific needs.

          <span class="servicesEmphasis"></span>
          <span class="servicesInlineEmphasis">Myofascial Release</span>
          <br>
          Myofascial release involves wearing shorts and a sports top (for women) while the therapist holds areas of fascia restriction for extended periods, facilitating release. This technique encourages clients to bring awareness and presence to sensations in their bodies. Each session includes a consultation to tailor the treatment to your goals.

          <span class="servicesEmphasis"></span>
          <span class="servicesInlineEmphasis">Neuronal Integration Release/Bodywork</span>
          <br>
          This technique uses somatic releasing methods to address the automatic feedback loop between mind and body. By engaging and releasing this loop, clients gain more flexibility in their actions and decisions, reducing rigidity in thoughts and perceptions. This can lead to greater freedom, less chronic pain, and improved mental well-being over time. Each session includes a consultation to address your specific needs and goals.

        <h3 id="faqA1" class="faqAnswer">Preparing for Your First Appointment</h3>
        <p>
          • Arrive Early: Give yourself plenty of time to locate our facility. We are committed to starting appointments promptly.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Complete Paperwork: Ensure all required paperwork is completed online before your appointment. We cannot accommodate paperwork completion at the time of your visit, and failure to do so may result in rescheduling and potential charges.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Appointment Start: Your appointment begins when your provider escorts you to the treatment room. They will review your initial form, address any questions, and discuss your immediate concerns.
        </p>
        <h3 id="faqA2" class="faqAnswer">During Your Appointment</h3>
        <p>
          • Preparation: Your therapist will leave the room to prepare for your session, ensuring you are comfortable on the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Cell Phone Policy: Turn off your cell phone to focus on your relaxation.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Post-Session Care: Allow yourself time to relax after your session. Avoid strenuous activities or returning immediately to work.
        </p>
        <h3 id="faqA2" class="faqAnswer">Massage Information</h3>
        <p>
          • Purpose: Massage aims to relax your body and shift your nervous system into a parasympathetic state. Any touch involved is strictly professional and non-sexual.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Uncomfortable Situations: If the therapist feels uncomfortable at any point, they will leave the room, and you will be charged for the full duration of the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Paperwork: Complete all necessary paperwork online prior to your appointment. Failure to do so may result in a shortened session.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Personal Hygiene: Arrive fresh and clean. You may want to exfoliate your skin beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Illness: Do not come to your session if you are feeling unwell.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Hydration: Drink water before and after your appointment to aid in detoxification and hydration.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Communication: Clearly communicate your goals and boundaries with your therapist. Undress to your comfort level, typically with less clothing to facilitate treatment. Expect to be draped during the massage.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Emotional Release: Emotional or somatic release can occur during a session. If you feel uncomfortable, communicate with your therapist immediately.

        <p>
          • Clothing: Wear loose-fitting clothing such as a t-shirt and shorts or sweatpants. Bring these items to change into after your initial assessment.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Personal Hygiene: Arrive fresh and clean.

          • Emotional and Physical Release: Be prepared for potential emotional and physical releases. Communication with your therapist is crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Silence and Listening: Silence is important for tuning into your body's signals. Follow your practitioner's instructions to align with your best interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Post-Session Care: After your session, take time to process your experience. Focus on relaxation and reach out to your practitioner or a mental health professional if needed.

        <p>
          • Advance Notice: Cancellations should be made 48 hours or more in advance. Late cancellations (less than 48 hours) incur a fee of 50% of the appointment value. Same-day cancellations or no-shows will be charged 100% of the appointment value.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Pre-Payments: Clients who cancel less than 48 hours in advance twice will be required to pre-pay for appointments, which will be non-refundable.

        <h3 id="faqA5" class="faqAnswer">Running Late</h3>
